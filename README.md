## ⚙️ How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RohanRathod777/C‑Programming.git
````

### 2. Explore by chapter

Open each folder (e.g., `CH01_Basics/`) and examine the code files and README within to understand the topic.

### 3. Practice & experiment

Build the example programs, tweak them, add your own variations, and experiment with logic and memory handling.
